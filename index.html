                            BAR&shy;TELLA, Ir&shy;aq — Our con&shy;voy
                            had already been tar&shy;geted by sui&shy;cide
                            car bombs three times, over a long day spent
                            un&shy;der fire. So the Ir&shy;aqi forces had
                            brought up a tank, and its main gun kept
                            scan&shy;ning the road ahead to&shy;ward
                            Mo&shy;sul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the shouts star&shy;ted com&shy;ing
                            from be&shy;hind us in&shy;stead, and when
                            I turned to look, I knew right away: Here
                            was Bomb No. 4, seem&shy;ingly out of nowhere.
                            By the time I saw it, the vehicle was maybe
                            70 feet away.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            We were with a unit of elite Ir&shy;aqi
                            coun&shy;terter&shy;ror&shy;ism forces, who
                            on the morn&shy;ing of Oct. 20 were mak&shy;ing
                            their first moves in the broad&shy;er battle
                            to take Mo&shy;sul back from the
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The com&shy;mandos’ first big
                            ob&shy;ject&shy;ive was to sur&shy;round and
                            clear Bar&shy;tella, a mil&shy;it&shy;ant-held
                            town about six miles east of the out&shy;er
                            fringes of Mo&shy;sul. Start&shy;ing out from
                            an Ir&shy;aqi base around 5 a.m., the troops
                            began push&shy;ing east along the main
                            high&shy;way that links the Kur&shy;d&shy;ish
                            re&shy;gion&shy;al cap&shy;it&shy;al, Er&shy;bil,
                            with Mo&shy;sul.

                        <p>
                            Un&shy;der peace&shy;ful cir&shy;cum&shy;stances,
                            that drive would take maybe an hour and a half.
                            But it would take the unit we were with nearly
                            all day just to push three miles in&shy;to
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State ter&shy;rit&shy;ory to
                            the west&shy;ern edge of Bar&shy;tella, where
                            the troops were to cut off the Is&shy;lam&shy;ic
                            State fight&shy;ers holed up in the town,
                            keep&shy;ing them from es&shy;cap&shy;ing to
                            Mo&shy;sul or be&shy;ing re&shy;in&shy;forced
                            from there. There were bombs all along the road,
                            and nearly every vil&shy;lage along the way would
                            be a...
